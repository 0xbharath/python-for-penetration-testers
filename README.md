# Python for Penetration Testers

## Workshop intro

This workshop is meant to be a quick intro to essentials of Python language and usig Python to automate various tasks that you encounter during a penetration test. We'll spend some amount of time learning the Python language itself and some amount of time in automating security tasks.

## Learning outcomes

- You'll learn essentials of Python programming language to be able to write your own (simple) scripts/tools
- You'll learn to use Python language to automate various tasks during security assessments
- You'll learn enough Python to be able to read others code and tweak the code to work for your case
- You'll get a kick start with Python programming that is enough to continue learning the language on your own

## What will be covered?

1. Quick intro to Python programming
2. Interacting with various protocols using Python(especially HTTP & DNS)
3. Working with various data formats in Python(JSON, XML etc)
4. Using various security related third-party libraries/tools in Python
5. Python related concepts that will help you in writing and publishing (better) security tools
6. Writing simple web scrapers

## What not to expect out of the workshop?
- Coverage of intermediate/advanced Python concepts such as Generators, Iterators, Object Oriented concepts and multithreading etc
- This is a workshop is geared towards penetration testers who want to use Python to automate security tasks so don't expect an exhaustive intro penetration testing during the workshop
 
## What do you need to know?

- Little bit of programming experience in some language but not necessarily Python is preferable. (Enough to know what is a variable, 'if' conditonal, 'for' loop etc.). Concepts covered in this document should be enough: Python in one Easy Lesson
- Some exposure to Penetration Testing is expected. We don't expect audience to be proficient at pentesting but we will expect that you know the basics of a pentest
- Basic knowledge of Linux command-line is necessary (Usage of commands like cd, ls, grep, less etc.)
- Able to use at least any one command line and one graphical text editor (nano, vim, gedit, Sublime, VS Code etc)
