# Tuples

- **Tuples are like lists but are immutable and are of fixed size** (tuples are not strictly immutable because elemets inside tuples can be mutable).
- Tuples have no other methods other than builtinâ€™s 
- Tuples are faster than lists.
- Tuples are immutable so they protect from data being changed
- Tuples can be used as keys in a dictionary

```python
my_tuple = ('val0', 'val1',[1,2])
```
