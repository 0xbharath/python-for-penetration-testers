# Lists

- Lists are one of the great datastructures in Python. We are going to learn a little bit about lists now
- Lists are basically a collection of elements of any data type
- Lists are **mutable**. They can be changed after they are created
- Indexing & Slicing mechanism is consistent with strings
- Python provides numerous methods on lists. Just dir(list_name) to get a list of all the methods available

```
my_list = ['item0', 'item1','item2']
```

```
colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green']
print colors[0]    ## red
print colors[2]    ## green
print len(colors)  ## 3
```
