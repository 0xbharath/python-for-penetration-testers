# Variables

- **Declaration of variables is not required in Python**. If you want to use a variable, assign it a value and start using it

- **Variable type can change during run time**. You can assign an string value to a variable, use it as an integer for a while and then assign a list to the variable. 

```python
target = "example.org"
target = 8080
```
